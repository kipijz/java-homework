Iâ€™ll have the Neapolitan cappuccino, More Cappa than Chino. Make sure it's got no more than four ounces of milk, the beans won't have the right texture otherwise.
And make sure they spell my name correctly on the cup- they always put Voxxie or Roxy, I hate that. If you can't handle that, I'll have a Venti Traditional Misto.
Please use soy milk with two blonde shots, adffogato and ristretto. I'd also love three vanilla pumps at the very bottom, then add the coffee after.
